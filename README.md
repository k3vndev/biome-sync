# 🌿 Biome Sync

**Biome Sync** keeps all your [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) configs in perfect harmony — no more copy-pasting `biome.json` across projects like it’s 2015. It automatically fetches your preferred config, installs Biome if needed, and makes sure every project stays consistent.


## 🚀 Features

✅ **Instant setup** — Run one command and Biome Sync takes care of everything.
✅ **Automatic Biome install & init** — Never wonder if Biome is missing again.
✅ **Schema preservation** — Keeps your `$schema` line right where it belongs (at the top 👑).
✅ **Sync from GitHub (or local file)** — Fetch your global config or use your own custom one.
✅ **Cross-project consistency** — One config to rule them all.


## 🔮 Coming Soon

🧠 **Auto-detect package manager** — Works with `pnpm`, `npm`, or `bun` without changing a thing.
🎨 **Colorful console output** — Because pretty logs make debugging less painful.
⚡ **Better error handling** — Catch dumb mistakes before they nuke your setup.
📂 **Local config support** — Use a file instead of a URL when working offline.
🤫 **Silent/CI mode** — For when you want automation without all the chatty logs.
🧩 **Custom rules merging** — Combine your base config with project-specific tweaks.
